# Data_analysis_using_python_only
i had just started learning data science and made some  easy data analysis project using just python 

i will tell what i actually did in this 
so for project 01
 i had given some data that you can check in "codebook_data.json" file which is in the form of json and i had to give their information  for example their name and their freinds and their liked pages

 and for project-02 
just some changes in data is that their is some inactive user with duplicate pages and freinds and i have to remove that and sort it
